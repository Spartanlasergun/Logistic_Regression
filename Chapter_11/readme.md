# Notes

In Chapter Eleven, the end of chapter problems are structured in the following order:
* 5 regular math questions
* 5 True or False questions
* 10 True or False questions

The first set of regular math questions are labeled with the prefix 'Question' and assigned a number from 1 to 5 accordingly. The first 5 'True or False' questions are given in the notebook 'True_or_False_01.ipynb', and the next 10 'True or False' questions are given in the notebook "True_or_False_02.ipynb".
