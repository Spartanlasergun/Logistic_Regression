# Notes

In Chapter One, the end of chapter problems are structured in the following order:
* 10 regular math problems
* 20 True or False questions
* 14 regular math problems

The 'True or False' questions are situated in the middle of the regular math problems and the author does not adjust the numbering for proper
chronology. As such, all of the 'True or False' questions are given in a single notebook entitled 'True_or_False.ipynb' and the remaining
problems inherit the numbers that are given in the text.
