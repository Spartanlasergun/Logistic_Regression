# Notes

In Chapter Thirteen, the end of chapter problems are structured in the following order:
* 15 regular math questions
* 5 True or False questions
* 5 regular math questions

The first set of regular math questions are labeled with the prefix 'Question' and assigned a number from 1 to 15 accordingly. The 5 'True or False' questions are given in the notebook 'True_or_False.ipynb', and the 5 remaining regular math questions are answered in unique notebooks with the prefix 'Test_Question' and a corresponding number from 6 to 10 according to their number in the text.
