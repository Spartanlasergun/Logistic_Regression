The first 10 True or False questions are given in the notebook "True_or_False_01.ipynb". The following 20 regular math questions are given in notebooks labeled with the prefix 'Question' and assigned a number from 11 to 30 accordingly. The next 5 'True or False' questions are given in the notebook "True_or_False_02.ipynb", and the 13 remaining regular math questions are answered in unique notebooks with the prefix 'Test_Question' and a corresponding number from 6 to 18 according to what is given in the text.
