The first set of regular math questions are labeled with the prefix 'Question' and assigned a number from 1 to 10 accordingly. The 6 remaining regular math questions are answered in unique notebooks with the prefix 'Test_Question' and a corresponding number from 1 to 6 according to their number in the text.
