# Notes

In Chapter Six, the end of chapter problems are structured in the following order:
* 10 regular math questions
* 10 True or False questions
* 6 regular math questions

The first set of regular math questions are labeled with the prefix 'Question' and assigned a number from 1 to 10 accordingly. The 10 'True or False' questions are given in the notebook 'True_or_False.ipynb', and the six remaining regular math questions are answered in unique notebooks with the prefix 'Test_Question' and a corresponding number from 11 to 16 according to what is given in the text.
