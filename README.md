# Logistic Regression

The book "Logistic Regression: A Self-Learning Text" by David Kleinbaum & Mitchel Klein, contains practice exercises at the end of each chapter. These include true and false questions as well as regular math problems that typically require a calculator. Within the text, solutions to the questions are given at the end of each chapter, and at the end of the book. 

In the textbook, the structure of the exercise questions given at the end of each chapter is a bit archaic, with true and false question typically interspersed with regular math problems. In each chapter a brief note describing the layout is provided in the 'readme.md'.
