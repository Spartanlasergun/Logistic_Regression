# Logistic Regression

The book "Logistic Regression: A Self-Learning Text" by David Kleinbaum & Mitchel Klein, contains pratice exercises at the end of each chapter. These include true and false questions as well as regular math problems that typically require a calculator. Solutions to the questions are given at the end of each chapter, and at the end of the book. The solutions given in this archive are part of my daily math problem solving routine, that is primarily meant for my own edification. I have made it available here in case others might benefit from a second glance through the lens of programming. The solutions typically line up exactly with those given in the text, with very few exceptions. 

If you spot any issues or errors, just open an issue for me stating the chapter and the question number. Other questions or comment, email me: bns360@live.com
