# Notes

In Chapter Ten, the end of chapter problems are structured in the following order:
* 8 regular math questions
* 8 True or False questions
* 4 regular math questions

The first set of regular math questions are labeled with the prefix 'Question' and assigned a number from 1 to 8 accordingly. The 8 'True or False' questions are given in the notebook 'True_or_False.ipynb', and the 4 remaining regular math questions are answered in unique notebooks with the prefix 'Test_Question' and a corresponding number from 9 to 12 according to their number in the text.
